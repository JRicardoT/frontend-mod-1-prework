## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
Since I was still working until the beginning of this week I barely even applied the Pomodoro technique to my workflow. My object was to finish at least a section a day and so far so good. Once I start Mod 1 I'm actually going to apply it because working for really long period of time can be really exhausting and does not allow the brain to process everything it just took in.  

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
My goal for the day was met and it took me about the amount of time I thought it was going to take me. I did apply the pomodoro today and it did help me staying a bit more focused.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
Just like an array an object allows us to store a list of data but a major key difference is that an array can have any type of data in it while an object stores data that is all related to the object being described.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  - An array would be better to store this data since it's data that's not to complex.
  * List of states and their capitals
  - On object would be the better choice for this scenario since we have more complex data. The capitals can be stored inside the states.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  - An array because it's just listing simple items that required no further explanation.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  - I would use an array for this scenario because we're just making a list of names.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  - I would use an object because I can store the cohort inside the name. An array would display them separately.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  - An object would be perfect for this scenario because you can store many different ingredient needed for the cake.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  - An array seems logical for this.Again, it's just a list of names.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
- I use myChevrolet app on my phone. An object that can potentially be used in that application is `vehicleStatus`. In this object they store how my vehicle is doing. some of the potential `key-value pair` that are being used to store this data are:
* `fuelLevel: 87;`
* `tirePressure: 38;`
* `oilLife: 62;`
* `odometer: 77920`

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
Not really a question but I found myself having trouble running some code on the exercise `tweet`. I kept trying to declare a function inside a class and my code wouldn't run because of it. Then I looked back at my noted and noticed that the `function` keyword wasn't needed in there.
