## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
I agree with everything on this list but the ones that stood out the most to me were "Super learners view learning as a process" and "They adopt a growth mindset" because this is something that I started to implement in my life at an early stage. I've always known what I want for myself and my family so I stay open to many different options and approaches to get where I want to be and I use this same concept when learning new things. But who knows if i'll be satisfied once i get to the goal because I think you always have to stay hungry wanting more, and wanting to improve. There is always room for that. I also noticed that I need to start practicing more of a few of these habits such as reading more and taking better care of my brain. lastly, I think that there are a couple of habits that are missing on this list such as staying organized and manage your time wisely.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
In this section we went over strings, booleans, and numbers. These are my own definitions of each;
- String: A piece of text that can use letters and other characters, but it has to be wrapped in quotes (" "). Also, opening and closing quotes need to be the same.
- Numbers: There are two parts to numbers. one is a whole number (can be positive or negative) and it's referred to as an integer. The other is a float and it uses decimals.
- Booleans: The value of true or false. We write the variable name for a boolean in such a way that it will respond true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
I could just use console.log() and insert the string `"Hello World!"` inside the parenthesis. For example:
console.log(`"Hello World!"`);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// two backslashes are used to write a single line comments
/* a backlash and an asterisk are used to write multiple line comments and you close the comments with the asterisk first and the backslash at the end as such */
Comments are used to add information in the code you wrote for other developers to understand what is going on with that code. Comments are written in plain english or in our written spoken language. Comment are also used to de-activate parts of our code.


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is the name to a value. Or you can say it's used to store information that can be re-used. You declare a variable by using the keyword var followed by the name, the assignment operator, and lastly its value.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
I love traveling so Airbnb is definitely an app that i frequently use. These are some of the variables I imagine are used:
1. var destination = "Cancun"
2. var numberOfDays = 7
3. var isItEntireHome = true
The first one is probably given the value of a string, for the second one a number, and for the last one a boolean.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is used to join together different data types into a string. We use the same operator that use to add numbers (+).

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
Going back to Airbnb, i think developers used concatenation to display the big pieces of text shown in the homepage of the app.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Will concatenation always convert any data type into a string ?
