## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
Asking questions has always been hard for me because I don't dislike being judged but recently I've come to the conclusion that learning new content
is hard and questions should be asked. I do tend to wait too long, because I like to figure things out on my own. But, after reading these blog post I realized I'm wasting too much time.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
Not really knowing what to research was the most uncomfortable part about it but I liked it because getting out of your comfort zone allows for growth. It makes you look for different strategies and lets you come across helpful information.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement evaluates if something is true or false and determines if an action(in programming it would be code) is executed or not.
Example of daily life conditional:
 - if (isHungry === true) {
   console.log("Go make some tacos!");
 } else {
   console.log("Don't eat");
 }

 Example of conditional used in NFCU banking app:
  - if (inputCorrectPasscode === true) {
    console.log("Welcome" + userName);
  } else {
    console.log("There was an issue signing in with passcode provided." + "Please try again");
  }

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
You add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by adding `else if`. A program reads them one by one. If first conditions evaluates to true it runs the block of code attached to it and it stops there. If it evaluates to false it moves on the next condition and it so on. If none of the conditions evaluate to true it runs the block of code on the `else` statement.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
`Logical operators` are great tools to check that two conditions are met. Comparison operators in conditional statements are great to check that 1 of two conditions are met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
Just so I know that I'm understanding this right. Parameters act like variables with no value (it's just the name given to the piece of info we need)
and the arguments are the actual value given to these names, correct?
