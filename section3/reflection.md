## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
 Two points from the article and the video that resonated to me were to understand that mistakes are essential to learning, to track your own progress and not compare yourself to others.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I always seek a challenge to expand my understanding of things and learn new skills. I understand that I don't know everything and mistakes are bound to happen when doing or learning something new. I learn from those mistakes and I apply what worked the next time around. With that being said, I focus on what worked and what didn't, so I can rethink my approach to whatever task is at hand. One way sometimes I tend to have a fixed mindset is when I try to compare my progress to someone else. I'm still working on tracking my own and learn that we all move at different paces.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
In facebook developers probably use arrays  to store all the likes in a post. It probably stores all the names of the people that executed that action.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is an action that allows to modify an array to an extent.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of loops is to check through conditions until one of them returns false and run codes of block if true. We would use a loop by itself to run a single block of code a specific number of times. We would use a loop in conjunction with in array if we want to print or get the values inside of certain array one by one without having to go through the list(array) manually one by one. We would also use a loop with in array to add blocks of code to a single value in an array or multiple.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop is used to repeat things over and over again. You can tell it to stop repeating by giving it a number of times it can repeat itself.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
Can you also implement loops-arrays into a function. The last problem in loops-arrays had me thinking that that would be the most logical way of approaching it and it also had me stuck for a while because of it.
