//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals.push("Gorilla");
console.log(animals);
// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals[3] = ("Panther");
console.log(animals)
// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
console.log(animals[2]);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["banana", "orange", "mango", "apple"];
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.unshift("broccoli");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.push("carrots", "tomatoes", "potatoes");
console.log(foods);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();
console.log(foods);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: This is also an oversimplification of how the data is stored but im going to use amazon for this first
// example. If we think of the cart in amazon we probably have items that we're thinking of buying in the
// future. So I think amazon's application saves these items as an array. For example:
var cart = ["LED desk lamp", "power strip", "beats pill speaker"];

// 2: Now Im going to be referring to facebook for the next two examples. I think Facebook stores the
 //people in our friendlist in arrays and this is how I picture it:
 var friends = ["Chris Evans", "Chris Hemsworth", "Mark Ruffalo", "Tom Holland"]
// 3: In your Facebook profile you can also add your featured Pictured and I think those are also
// stored as an array.
var featuredPhotos = ["picture in Tokyo", "picture with elephant", "picture with monkey", "picture with friends"];

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 16;
var hasCharger = false;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here

// if first condition, the percentage of the battery is greater than or equal to 15 evaluates
// to true, it will print the line "You can call an uber".
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  console.log("You can call an uber");
// If first contition evaluates to false, it will go to this second block of code. In this
// case it's using a logical And operator to compare both conditions. It will only evaluate to true
// if both conditions themselves evaluate to true. If it does evaluate to true it will print out
// the line "You can now call an uber".
} else if ((hasCharger === true) && (chargerType === "car")){
  console.log("You can now call an uber");
  // If none of the conditions above evaluate to true the line "Please charge phone" will be logged.
} else {
  console.log("Please charge phone");
}


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it doesðŸŒŸ
