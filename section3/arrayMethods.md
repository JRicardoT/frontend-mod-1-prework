 1. `.pop()` removes the last value from an array in a variable and it returns that value that was removed. It also changes the length of the array because one value was removed. When you call `.pop()` on an empty array, it returns `undefined`. The syntax for it is `arrayName.pop();`.

2. You can add one or more values to the end of an array with the `.push()`. This method can also return the value of the new length of the array after pushing a new value(s) into it. You can also merge two variables with a value of an array together. The syntax for it is `arrayName.push();`.

3. `.shift()` removes the first value in an array and returns that value. Just like the other two methods on this list, `.shift()`, will alter the length of the array. the syntax for this method is `arrayName.shift();`. Also returns `undefined` if the array is empty.

4. You can add one or more values to the beginning of an array using `.unshift()`. Just like all other methods in this list it can return the value of the new length of the array.
